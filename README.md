# Methods and tools for evaluating probabilistic forecasts

This repository contains documentation and code for evaluating probabilistic forecasts.
Although collated for ecological studies, these methods apply broadly across domains.

At present, the main focus of this repository is a manuscript,
but additional documents and code blocks will be added over time.

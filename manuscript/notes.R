before adding the ensembles 

broad brush skill score indicates that (relative to model 1)
model 3 generally, but not exclusively, tends to be better than model 2
this is more evident in the first prediction (lead 1), and diminishes by 
the laste prediction (lead 12). the difference still persists with the log
score (indicating that mod3 has more mass at the observed value) but doesnt
with the crps (indicating that the predictive distributions of the two models
are about equally close to the observed value)

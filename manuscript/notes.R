statistical report in ecology makes good sense
will need to cut considerably to get to 20 pgs
initial goal to 30 pages


one paragraph per idea
trying to say stuff in too much detail

think about weaving the example in through the sections as moving along
rather than have its own section
also put details in an appendix 

think about cutting the discussion to 4 paragraphs

trimming citation strings...target reviews as much as possible

a conceptual figure for why probabilistic forecasting is important 
figure 3 but more basic for comparison

next steps: do a big cut, then pass back

lessons?

pps only ever were reliably recorded with 2 in a trap twice in plot 19
only 29 times across all the plots, always 2 in a trap
so a hard limit of 50 per plot is totally fine


m1ok
running some smalls to test through with the harder upper limit
